# REDI_Bank_Py
Bank account. Final Project for "Python intermediate" in REDI School.
There are 3 classes:
class Bank is the place for actions, class Customer is a user, and class Bankaccount is a bankaccont. 
I created a couple of examples  customers and accounts in main. Other customers and other accounts can also be created in the program. Each customer can have many accounts. The account knows its owner by the username. The username and account number are unique. Depending on the user's choice, the program jumps from method to method. Admin mode is also available. The password for anmin is 1111. The admin can make changes to user information.
This is a release of version 1.0. There are still bugs in this version, but I'm working on testing as much as possible and the version will be improved soon.
